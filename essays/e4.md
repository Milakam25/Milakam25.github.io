My programming skills have come a long way. Initially, I felt lost when it came to identifying and fixing issues, but now I have a better grasp on troubleshooting. I still struggle with remembering which code to use, though. Assignment 1 was tough because I kept forgetting the right code for different situations.
However, I've made great progress through WODs. Practicing them repeatedly has really made a difference. It's like my brain has memorized the steps through sheer repetition. Now, I can tackle WODs without relying on the screencast.
Labs have been incredibly beneficial too. Listening to lectures and watching recordings has helped me understand concepts better. I used to dread labs, but now I feel grateful for them. They're an opportunity to put what I've learned into practice, and I approach them with confidence.
Assignment 1 was a learning experience. It was challenging, but it taught me a lot. I'm excited to tackle Assignment 2 because it's my chance to create something of my own. Figuring out each step and solving errors independently was rewarding. It's satisfying to see my progress.
To improve the class, I think incorporating more hands-on coding work would be beneficial. As a visual learner, I find that actively working on code helps me understand better than just listening or looking at slides.
Screencasts and WODs have been the most helpful aspects of the class. Being able to see the process step by step makes it easier for me to apply the concepts to my own work.
