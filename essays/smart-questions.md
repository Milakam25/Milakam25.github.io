Invoice 1, I created a sales receipt for a sale that contains at least five different products using expressions and variables to compute the various needed values dynamically. 

The small mistakes slowed me down. I accidentally put <tr> twice in invoice1, causing the whole list not to show up on the website. I had a hard time finding the mistake while recording, so I had to stop and figure it out. Rushing while recording can also lead to poor results and take more time, so I carefully looked at each step, and that worked very well!

I did similarly with the WODs before this. I practiced and learned which code would do what, and it made me feel so confident when I recorded and worked on it.

I will try to adjust time to have more time next time so I donâ€™t need to stress out when errors show up at the last minute. Rushing or stressing out too much will not lead to good results, so I will make sure to start working on it a little earlier.
