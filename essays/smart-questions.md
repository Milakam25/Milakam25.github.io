Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to the WOD page for further details

Invoice 1, I created a sales receipt for a sale that contains at least five different products using expressions and variables to compute the various needed values dynamically. 

Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.

The small mistakes slowed me down. I accidentally put <tr> twice in invoice1, causing the whole list not to show up on the website. I had a hard time finding the mistake while recording, so I had to stop and figure it out. Rushing while recording can also lead to poor results and take more time, so I carefully looked at each step, and that worked very well!

Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WODs before this?

I did similarly with the WODs before this. I practiced and learned which code would do what, and it made me feel so confident when I recorded and worked on it.

Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.

I will try to adjust time to have more time so I donâ€™t need to stress out when errors show up at the last minute. Rushing or stressing out too much will not lead to good results, so I will make sure to start working on it a little earlier.
