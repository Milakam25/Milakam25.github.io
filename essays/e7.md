Assignment 2 was the most challenging assignment for me. It involved connecting everything and ensuring that all components worked seamlessly. While it may sound simple, it was actually quite difficult because even minor errors could disrupt the entire process leading to the next page. Despite seeking assistance from ChatGPT, it didn't provide much help in solving the errors. Instead, I had to rely on ChatGPT for ideas and then figure out the solutions on my own. Going through this process taught me the importance of being specific because computers only follow the instructions they are given. Practice and analyzing the errors and suggestions from ChatGPT were instrumental in helping me identify and resolve all the issues.

I learned the importance of having an organized website while creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352. I believe that website design is crucial because a well-designed site attracts visitors. Having my own professional portfolio was a rewarding experience, and integrating it into ITM helped me organize my materials effectively. Regarding WODs, I found them incredibly beneficial for getting accustomed to coding. Although challenging, they were enjoyable, and seeing everything work smoothly on time was highly satisfying. WODs improved both my timing and coding skills. As for quizzes, they were okay, but not overly helpful since they didn't indicate which answers were incorrect. From labs, I learned the importance of working step by step; skipping a step can lead to confusion and mistakes. Careful attention to each step is crucial. Reflecting on and reviewing my work, especially through essay writing, helped me organize my thoughts and identify mistakes, guiding my next steps. Through completing Assignments 1 and 2, I learned that every small step can have a significant impact and that one element can tie everything together. Every line of code is vital for the overall success of the project.

When I first enrolled in this class, I was very behind, and I had no knowledge of coding. Consequently, I struggled immensely to catch up. Seeking assistance, I approached Professor Port for help and also reached out to many friends. However, after participating in WODs , I gained more confidence in completing my assignments. I dedicated countless hours to practicing, eventually becoming accustomed to coding. I believe that recording my WODs truly helped, as it made me more careful and focused on each step, despite feeling nervous at times.

As I went through the course, I noticed my skills growing in three main areas: understanding basic code (syntactic), problem-solving (algorithmic), and applying what I learned to real situations (application). At first, I was just getting the hang of writing code and understanding how it worked (syntactic). Then, as I got more comfortable, I started to think more about how to solve problems with code (algorithmic). Finally, the hands-on projects with web-based e-service applications really helped tie everything together. It was like putting all the puzzle pieces in place. This experience made me even more excited for future ITM classes.

I used ChatGPT to check for errors and help design my website or fix my grammar, as English is my second language. It really helps me fix grammatical mistakes whenever I am writing essays. The designs it generates are also very accurate, as requested, but you still have to make changes because simply copying and pasting won't work. Therefore, I believe some people might be copying and pasting and then blaming ChatGPT for giving wrong or messed up results. However, it's important to be aware that ChatGPT won't provide a perfect solution; you'll always need your own skills to refine and use its suggestions as just ideas.

In ITM 352, I learned how to build websites and analyze data. This helps me solve problems with information systems better, like making data systems run smoother or improving websites for users. These skills will be super useful in my future job, where I can use them to make businesses better. This course has been really helpful for my education and getting ready for my career in tech.
