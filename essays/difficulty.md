When I applied to UH Manoa, I was in a completely different field. I then took a one-semester break to think about what I want to do in the future and what would be the most helpful job in this digital world. The MIS major came to my mind. I do not have any computer or coding skills, but when I was researching MIS, it became more and more interesting. In this generation, everything is convenient, and many people believe that in the future, robots would replace humans. Therefore, I was thinking that becoming the one who controls robots or computers would be great. Majoring in MIS and learning it in college seemed like a good idea. That's why I decided to major in MIS.
